# Simple todo app using the MERN stack

### (using bun as runtime but it feels wrong to write MERB stack)

- ### create backend endpoints:
  - created endpoints to post a todo, get all todos and put endpoint to update a todo
  - using zod for input validation
  - mark todo as done (update data in db)
